# 💻 The Laptop Finder AI

Buying a laptop is confusing. **The Laptop Finder** solves this by removing the technical jargon. Instead of asking for "CPU specs" or "RAM type," it asks the user about their **lifestyle** and **budget**, then uses a smart filtering algorithm to recommend the single best machine.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Smart Filtering:** Matches user needs (Coding, Gaming, Editing) with budget constraints.
- **"Can It Run?" Engine:** Instantly tells users if the recommended laptop can handle **GTA V**, **VS Code**, or **4K Editing**.
- **Jargon-Free UI:** Simple, step-by-step interface designed for non-techies.
- **Affiliate Ready:** Integrated "Check Price" buttons optimized for Amazon Associates.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The tool uses a lightweight JavaScript database of laptops. When a user selects their preferences:
1.  **Input:** User selects Usage (e.g., Coding) + Budget (e.g., Under ₹60k).
2.  **Process:** The algorithm filters the array to find the best `match`.
3.  **Fallback:** If no exact match exists, it intelligently downgrades to the best available option in that price range.
4.  **Output:** Displays the laptop, price, and a "Reality Check" list (Battery life, Gaming performance).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism effects)
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages
- **Zero Dependencies:** No external libraries or frameworks required.
